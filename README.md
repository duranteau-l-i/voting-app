# VotingApp / FreeCodeCamp Project

This project is part of the backend section: Dynamic Web Application Projects.

The goal is to create an application with these
[instructions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-voting-app)
and to follow this [example](https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/polls).

##I have made some improvements to it.

1.  First of all the application was realized with node.js and express.js for the backend part.
    Angular with angle-cli and bootstrap for the frontend part.

2.  The offline user can see the list of polls and click to view statistics.

3.  Only an administrator can create a poll.
    He can see the list of polls he has created and delete the one he no longer wants.
    He cannot participate in a survey, but only see the statistics.

4.  The logged-in user can participate in a survey, but only once. If he clicks again, he will only be able to view the statistics.

5.  Both administrator and user can reset their password.
